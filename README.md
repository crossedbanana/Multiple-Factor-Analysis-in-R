# Multiple-Factor-Analysis-in-R

The goal of the project is to create an R package that implements Multiple Factor Analysis (MFA).
The package contains unit tests as well as vignette(s). A shiny app is also created to provide a companion interactive
visualization tool for the package.

Tips for installing the MFA package:

• download MFA folder from the repository
• open mfa.R in Rstudio
• run the code in the file "devtools workflow.R" (the package mfa should be installed in your computer after this)
