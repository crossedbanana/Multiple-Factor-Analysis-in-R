# Multiple-Factor-Analysis-in-R

The goal of the project is to create an R package that implements Multiple Factor Analysis (MFA).
The package contains unit tests as well as vignette(s). A shiny app is also created to provide a companion interactive
visualization tool for the package. [demo](https://siweiwu.shinyapps.io/multiple_factor_analysis/)

Tips for installing the MFA package:

* download MFA folder from the repository
* open mfa.R in Rstudio
* run the code in the file "devtools workflow.R" (the package mfa should be installed in your computer after this)
